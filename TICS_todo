For xy test: 

- [Done] add calibration in the configuration file
- [Done] Modify connect4.py for reading xytable instead of movetable
- [Done] Testing xy code
- [Done] producing xy test 
- [Done] unit tests for moves with rebekah 16-02
- [Done] write all the infos 16-02- [todo] change database for sep =','
- [Done] every cruise move should take in account the ramp (up/down). For standard case, we have 1.995 deg x2 
- [Done] add backlash in direction 
- [Done] solved a bug in xylib for args in arccos 3h
- [Done] tested ramp fw 6.23  1h
- [Done] tested speed fw 6.23  1h
- [Done] implement speed flags 2h


- [todo] make local code write the conf and copy it for the remote
- [Done] test speed implementation
- [todo] add is_target to database to differentiate what is approaching move, angle move and targeting move
- [todo] unpark the positioner with a small creep move 
- [todo] read params in remote
- [todo] read params in local codes
- [todo] Presentation checking histograms of xytest for different speed, ramp setup
Report
- [] calibration, R1, R2, arcs centers (phi, theta), stability of degrees in phi (residuals removing the hardstop  ) , check theta, measure the positioner backlash
